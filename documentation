## Explanation by Alex
Our goal should be to identify the sources, and make a catalog with the PSF's.
Broadly speaking, there are two ways of approaching this:
    1. Treat the images (different lambda) separately. This would lead to
       a not-so-complete catalog.
    2. Treat the images simultaneously. Look for a source in one of the
       maps and then try to fit thye model by looking at the others. (I didn't
    understand this part very well).
One of our first outputs should be something like figure 1 in the paper.
## To do
- The filter still gives some nans
- Rescale the axes, since the filtered maps are still dominated by the things
  the borders.
- To make the catalogue, in pronciple we should find maxima on the map, and
  identify whether it's a legit source (PSF).
